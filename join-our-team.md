<p>Dear current or future real estate agent:</p>

<p>If you’re reading this, you are either already working at a real estate brokerage or are interested in pursuing a career in the industry.</p>

<p>Let make a few guesses about your current circumstances:</p>

<p>If you’re already an agent, you probably aren’t getting the support that you need to advance your career. Many brokerages don’t offer the leads, training, coaching, accountability, or structure required to succeed.</p>

<p>If you’re a new agent, you probably yearn for structure, accountability, and a clear path to success.</p>

<p>Did you know that 87% of real estate agents will fail to achieve the level of success they want and leave the industry within their first two years? <b>With 50,000 more Realtors joining NAR in the past three months, statistics say that 43,500 of them will fail.</b></p>

<p>You might long for a kind of lifestyle that your current job can’t afford you—the freedom to maintain your life outside of work as you please, the money to support your family as well as your personal goals, and the time to make all of it a reality.</p>

<p>If you’re kept awake at night because you live paycheck to paycheck and can’t guarantee where that next check will come from, you probably long for the weight of looming bills and the threat of bankruptcy to leave your shoulders. You yearn for guidance about what to do next and when to do it.</p>

<p><b>Perhaps you’ve already sought out a solution to these problems.</b> If you have found financial success in the business already, you’ve quickly learned that your clients run your calendar. Soon, relationships with family and friends will pay the price, and vacations will be spent keeping deals together and clients happy. It’s just not sustainable.</p>

<p>With all that in mind, here’s the thing: If you don’t do something different with your career, you’ll probably wind up like the rest of the 87% of the business—admitting defeat and leaving the industry forever. You’ll go back to a regular 9-to-5 job, forego the comfortable lifestyle you always dreamed of, and re-enter the cycle of worrying about making ends meet.
</p>

<p>But don’t let your frustrations, anxieties, and past misfortunes get you down. There is a solution to your problems, and it doesn’t involve letting the real estate business chew you up and spit you out:</p>

<p><b>I’d like to invite you in for a discussion about becoming a member of our brokerage.</b></p>

<p>My name is Kodi Riddle and I’ve been in the real estate business for the past 22 years. I’ve seen the ups and downs of the market, and I’ve navigated them successfully. My team has over five decades of experience, a database of over 18,000 agents, and we’re ranked in the top 1% of teams in the Valley.</p>

<p>I know how to build a successful business and I’m offering you the opportunity to learn from me. As someone who came to real estate after full-time mom duty for years, I also have a passion for helping women and mothers who are in a similar position find success. My technology helps agents get the most out of their businesses. If you’ve already found success, our systems and leverage can push you to an even higher level.</p>

<p><b>Let me be a little more specific about what my team has to offer:</b>
<ul class="indent">
<li>The latest technology</li>
<li>Accountability</li>
<li>A consistent flow of leads</li>
<li>Appointments</li>
<li>Lead generation systems</li>
<li>Brand awareness</li>
<li>Support staff</li>
<li>Great people</li>
<li>Over $500,000 annually worth of support</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>We have a holistic approach to real estate, aiming to build up the WHOLE Realtor.</b> We’re focused not only on their businesses but also on their life outside of work. We want our team members to make great money and have a great life, not have to choose one or the other.</p>

<p>If you’re skeptical, you don’t need to take just my word for it. <b>Let the success of a few of our agents speak for itself, and you can make up your own mind about it:</b></p>

<p>Ross, even taking a 5-day vacation, SOLD two homes in his first 30 days on the team. He is a brand new agent! Prior to joining the team, Will sold 12 months in 3 years.  AFTER joining the team, Will SOLD 10 homes in his first 9 months! Sandy, a mom with a young kiddo, has alreadyhad only sold 6 homes in her first 2 years in real estate.  She SOLD 14 homes in her first 10 months on our team!  Amanda's first closing was a $1.2 million home. Logan’s goal was to make $60,000 this year, and he’s already made $80,000 with 3 months to go! This is after-splits, take-home money in their pockets.  The success stories are piling up!</p>

<p><b>If you take me up on my offer to discuss whether you deserve a coveted seat at our table, I’d be glad to show you that we’re not all just talk—</b>we can prove that what we say actually happens.</p>

<p>Then again, you could also elect to go a different route. But I’ll warn you: Other big-box brokerages often foster a dog-eat-dog atmosphere in which you’re technically a part of the brand, but you’re still left to succeed (or fail) on your own. Many will spend a lot of their time calling or texting you so they can recruit you, but once you’re there, they don’t provide the resources you need to grow your business. Others still will promise you quality leads but fail to deliver.</p>

<p><b>When you join us, the onboarding process starts right away.</b> The minute you accept our offer, we’ll send you an email asking for your headshot, bio, and sphere of influence. On your start date, you will have a four-hour class directly with Kodi. Then, two hours on Zoom in the afternoon with Kodi. It’s a full day but we want you to start off on the right foot!  From then on, you’ll go through our 30-60-90 onboarding plan to get you up and running and get you into production quickly by implementing seven pillars of income in your business. The first three pillars of income are your sphere of influence, DB1000, and open houses. Those three pillars will be implemented immediately. Once you’re good at them, we’ll add four more: Additional leads, Appointments, Opportunity time & Sign calls.</p>

<p>The choice is yours: Face an uncertain industry full of mirages and false promises on your own—or become an agent on our team who consistently nets a predictable income while maintaining a lifestyle fit for you and your family. <b>I guarantee that you’ll take home a minimum of $60,000 in your first year with us or I’ll pay you the difference.</b></p>

<p>If your interest has been piqued, I do urge you to act quickly. The popular real estate service Redfin is gearing up for a massive advertising campaign across the USA to offer clients a low-commission environment. If you don’t have your business system in place before then, you’ll get crushed.</p>

<p>Let’s get on this now so we can build a moat around your mindset, skills, and most importantly, your database, allowing us to make sure you succeed in real estate regardless of what happens next.</p>

<p>I hope to hear from you soon!</p>

<p>Kodi Riddle</p>

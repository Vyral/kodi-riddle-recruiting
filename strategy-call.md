<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales.</p>

<a><img src="/img/agents.jpg" width="50%"></a>
<br>

<p>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p>My name is Kodi Riddle and I’ve sold over one thousand homes to date.</p>
  
<a><img src="/img/team.jpg" width="70%"></a>
<br><br>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes. </p>

<p>I’ll also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate leads and sales.</p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business <b>that’s authentic to you</b> (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc.), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who want to sell their home who list with you.</p>

<p>This will help you get the <b>commission consistency</b> and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">"Kodi is an amazing mentor. I've been lucky to have other amazing mentors and Kodi is absolutely one of the great ones. My numbers went from closing 3 or 4 homes to over 13 the first year I was with the team. She is helping me grow to close more each year. Kodi has been completely caring, understanding and has been there for me with love and genuine care and compassion personally every time I needed it and when I didn't know I needed it."</span>
<span class="author">- Sandy</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">"Kodi has given me a great education and understanding of my new field of real estate. She has helped me build confidence in my everyday life through business."</span>
<span class="author">- Logan</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">"Kodi has affected my professional life by pushing me to learn and grow. Not only does she provide you with training and coaching, but she also shares love and compassion towards helping employees succeed as individuals. Kodi has affected my personal life by encouraging me to be a stronger more confident woman. Kodi is powerful, confident and has been a role model to me."</span>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about joining our team.</p>

<a><img src="/img/runningmeeting.jpg" width="50%"></a>
<br>
<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me. We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<a><img src="/img/smiling.jpg" width="50%"></a>
<br><br><br>


<p>I have a <b>questionnaire</b> I would like you to fill out so that when we meet I'm prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Kodi Riddle</p>

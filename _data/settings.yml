  about_markdown: >
    After earning her degree from Arizona State University in 1994, Kodi went on to become an LPGA Golf Professional. Before college, she had never played the game and she became a member with the LPGA in less than 3 years. In a male dominated industry, Kodi’s tireless energy, determination and passion to succeed quickly propelled her to achieve her goals.

    Using these traits, in 1999, Kodi began what has become a successful real estate career. Very early on it was obvious to her that the only way to truly protect her clients was to work full-time in this industry. After just 6 months in real estate, she left the golf industry behind to become a full-time real estate agent. As soon as possible, she earned her broker’s license as well as her e-pro designation. With 22 years of experience and education, she has become an expert in her field.

    Kodi, her husband and two kids now live, work & play in the Cave Creek area. They have lived there since 1999 and truly adore Cave Creek and the surrounding area.

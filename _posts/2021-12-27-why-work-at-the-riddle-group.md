Here is what one of our employees, Logan, had to say about his experience working at The Riddle Group:

**What were you doing before real estate?**

*“Before real estate, I was in the bartending and service industry.”*

**How do you feel about your first year in real estate being with The Riddle Group?**

*“One of my favorite things about The Riddle Group is the education I've received. It’s great to have people there that can educate you, get you through the process, and help get you started.”*

**How would you describe Kodi as a leader?**

*“Kodi is a fierce leader, and she goes after it aggressively. She’s very helpful. If you have a question, it’ll be answered. She makes sure we’re on top of everything and understand the process, and that's great for our clients.”*

**How do you feel as you look back at your first year with the riddle group?**

*“It was great. It took me a little bit to get off the ground, but from what I understand, I actually moved a lot faster than agents from other teams. I think I'm ahead of the game.”*

If you have any questions or would like to hear about our open positions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.

Linda recently sat down with us to answer a few questions about her experience as a member of our team.

**What led you to joining The Riddle Group?**

Before I started working for Bill and Kodi, I hit a rough patch in my life. For the first time ever, I was looking for a job. It was pretty tough and scary. I’m not going to lie. I found them through my church, I reached out, and Kodi told me they just hired someone. It was a little heartbreaking, but I moved on. About a week later, I got a call from Kodi seeing if I was still available. Fortunately, I still was. I met with Kodi and Bill, and because of where I was in my life, they were awesome. They took a chance on me, and here we are five years later. It’s just been amazing, and I’m very blessed to be with them.

**What is it like working for Kodi Riddle?**&nbsp;

There’s a great question. I've been with her for five years, and I’m No. 7. It’s not about Kodi, it’s about what's best for the clients and for me to improve and get better and better. It’s been fun. It’s challenging, it’s hard, but it’s really good. And that’s what I like. That’s what brings me to get up every morning and go and do the best I can every day for Kodi, Bill, and the team. I love the team atmosphere we have. It’s just a really great place to be. It’s not easy, but it’s great.

**Describe Kodi as a leader:**

Kodi as a leader is really amazing. She is driven, hard-working, and she wants the best for every team member and every client. She pushes very hard because that's what we should do. One of her favorite sayings is “We do the right thing because it’s the right thing to do.” In the end, that really does make a huge difference.

If you have any questions for me about what it’s like on my team, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

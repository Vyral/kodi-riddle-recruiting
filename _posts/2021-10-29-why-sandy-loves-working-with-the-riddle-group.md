Today we’re talking to Sandy and asking her a few questions about her experience as a member of The Riddle Group.

**What were you doing before real estate?**

I was an HR manager for a startup company. I managed over 150 employees for 10 years.

**What was your first year with The Riddle Group like?**

My first year was amazing. I received all the support that I needed. I was a solo agent in the past, so being with a team was very different. The leadership was always supportive, always there to answer any questions that I had, and helped me grow in my real estate career.

**Describe Kodi as a leader.**

Kodi is just amazing. I could not ask for anyone better to be a mentor. She’s not only a leader, but she’s a mentor. She’s supportive, and she’s understanding that as we’re going through life, life happens. There’s nothing I can say about her that doesn’t bring a smile to my face. I know that I can go to her for anything and everything I need. I just couldn't ask for a better mentor.

If you have any questions about today’s topic, call or email us. We are always here to help.

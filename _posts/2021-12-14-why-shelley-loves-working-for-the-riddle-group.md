**What has your experience with The Riddle Group been like?**

I have worked for other teams similar to this, but the big difference is our team lead, Kodi Riddle. She devotes so much time and attention to making sure we all succeed. That’s the key to success that I've seen in this group that I have not seen with others.

**How is Kodi as a leader?&nbsp;**

She’s amazing. She has endless enthusiasm and truly believes in what she’s doing. She believes in your team’s success, in my success, and she’s amazing.

If you have any questions about working for The Riddle Group or the business in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
